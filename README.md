According to the World Trade Organization,
services comprise the largest and most
dynamic component of both developed and developing economies. Services are the
main way that organizations create value for themselves and their customers.
Almost all services today are IT-enabled, which means there is tremendous benefit
for organizations in creating, expanding, and improving their IT service management
capability.
Technology is advancing faster today than ever before. Developments such as cloud
computing, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), machine learning, and blockchain have
opened fresh opportunities for value creation, and led to IT becoming an important
business driver and source of competitive advantage. In turn, this positions IT
service management as a key strategic capability.
